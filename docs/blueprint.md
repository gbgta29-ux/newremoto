## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use WhatsApp's distinctive green (#128C7E) for the header and key interface elements, conveying familiarity.
- Background color: A desaturated, light tint of green (#D8E8E5) will provide a subtle backdrop, echoing the messaging app's visual tone.
- Accent color: A muted lime green (#25D366) is chosen to accent interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, will be used for all text elements to mirror WhatsApp's modern aesthetic. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Ensure the layout is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, replicating the WhatsApp mobile experience.
- Employ WhatsApp-style icons for message status (sent, delivered, read), audio recording, and other interactive elements.
- Implement subtle animations, such as typing indicators and message bubbles, to enhance the sense of a real-time conversation.
